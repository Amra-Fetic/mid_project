# **Superstore Sales Analysis Project**
Welcome to my mid bootcamp project.


## *Overview*
This project analyzes the Superstore dataset to derive insights into various aspects of sales trends, product performance, and customer segments. The goal is to understand patterns, make informed decisions, and explore potential future sales predictions.

## *Dataset*
The dataset used for this project is the "superstore_final_dataset (1).csv", found on kaggle.com ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/superstore-sales"). This data set is containing information about sales, products, customers, and regions, diferent segments, ship methods as also dates of order and shipping.

### **Questions and Answers**
1. Overall Sales Trend Over Time
To understand the overall sales trend over time, the project examines the historical sales data and visualizes it using appropriate graphs and charts.

2. Shipping Mode Analysis
Most Commonly Used Shipping Mode: The project identifies the shipping mode that is most commonly used.
Correlation with Sales: It investigates whether there is a correlation between the chosen shipping mode and higher sales.
3. Top-Selling Products and Categories
This section explores the dataset to determine:

Top-Selling Products: Identifies the products with the highest sales.
Top-Selling Categories: Determines the product categories that contribute the most to sales.
4. Customer Segment and Sales Correlation
The project investigates the relationship between customer segments and sales:

Customer Segments: Analyzes different customer segments.
Correlation with Sales: Examines whether there is a correlation between the segment of customers and the amount of sales.
5. Regional Sales Analysis
Examines how sales vary across different regions or countries, providing insights into regional performance.

#### Future Sales Prediction
The project includes a predictive analysis to forecast future sales based on historical trends and patterns identified in the dataset. This involves the use of appropriate machine learning or statistical models for accurate predictions.

### Running the Project
To run this dataset onto my jupyter notebook I used " pd.read_csv ("data/cleaned/superstore_final_dataset (1).csv", encoding="ISO-8859-1")".
